# Learning Server-Side API Requests with Axios
This project is part of my learning journey in Angela Yu’s Full-Stack Web Development Course on Udemy. It uses Express.js, EJS, and Axios to fetch activities from the Bored API and display them dynamically.
🚀 What I Learned
	1.	How to create server-side applications using Express.js.
	2.	How to use Axios to fetch data from external APIs.
	3.	How to render dynamic HTML using EJS templates.
	4.	How to handle user input with POST requests.
	5.	How to manage errors gracefully and display user-friendly messages.
💻 Technologies Used
 	•	Node.js
	•	Express.js
	•	EJS (Embedded JavaScript for templates)
	•	Axios (HTTP client for API requests)
	•	CSS for styling
 🧩 How It Works
	1.	Random Activity on Page Load:
	•	When you visit the homepage, the app makes an API request to get a random activity using Axios.
	•	The activity is displayed dynamically using an EJS template.
	2.	Filter Activities:
	•	You can select the type of activity (e.g., education, social, relaxation) and the number of participants using a form.
	•	Submitting the form sends a POST request to the server.
	3.	API Request and Result:
	•	The server fetches filtered activities from the Bored API based on your input.
	•	A random result is picked and displayed on the page.
	•	If no results are found, a friendly error message appears.
 🧑‍🎓 Why I’m Learning This
