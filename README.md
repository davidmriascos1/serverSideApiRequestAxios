# Learning Server-Side API Requests with Axios
This project is part of my learning journey in Angela Yu’s Full-Stack Web Development Course on Udemy. It uses Express.js, EJS, and Axios to fetch activities from the Bored API and display them dynamically.

🚀 What I Learned
- How to create server-side applications using Express.js.
- How to use Axios to fetch data from external APIs.
- How to render dynamic HTML using EJS templates.
- How to handle user input with POST requests.
- How to manage errors gracefully and display user-friendly messages.
💻 Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript for templates)
- Axios (HTTP client for API requests)
- CSS for styling
 🧩 How It Works
	1.	Random Activity on Page Load:
- When you visit the homepage, the app makes an API request to get a random activity using Axios.
- The activity is displayed dynamically using an EJS template.
	2.	Filter Activities:
- You can select the type of activity (e.g., education, social, relaxation) and the number of participants using a form.
- Submitting the form sends a POST request to the server.
	3.	API Request and Result:
- The server fetches filtered activities from the Bored API based on your input.
- A random result is picked and displayed on the page.
- If no results are found, a friendly error message appears.
 🧑‍🎓 Why I’m Learning This
